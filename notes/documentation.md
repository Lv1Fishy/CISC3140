## Beginning ##
    -   In games like the dark souls series, we often pick up items and consummables where we hoard the items and never used them
        even when the game intended you to use them to make a boss fight easier. The only items that were used often are consummable 
        souls for upgrades to character/weapons while items like pine resins (weapon buffs) are obsolete since later in the game, 
        there are spells/incantations that gives the same effect. 
    -   An example from Dark Souls 3, before the Vordt fight, if the player explored a little bit and manage to find the lightning
        pine resin, most of the time they would just keep it in their inventory for the rest of the game even though even though
        the boss has a lower lightning resistance. 
    -   One problem of games is that when players are playing a certain game for the first time, there are plenty of information 
        online from game wiki or there are plenty of information in-game documentation. However, most people do not enjoy reading 
        when all they want is just to play the game. 
    -   One of the best way to introduce a game new players is the aspect of show, not tell. In Half Life (1997), one of the best
        aspect of the game is the introduction of each weapon throughout the game. The introduction of the crowbow in the beginning
        of the game guides the player to break objects, the pistol allow the player to two-shot headcrabs which makes it amazing for
        conserving ammo, the smg three-shot headcrabs which tells the player that it trades ammo for DPS, etc. Not only did each 
        weapon can help the player progress throughout the game but it allow them to figure out what is the best approach when 
        facing a part of a level such as using bugs to flush out enemie around the corner. 

# Plans #
    -   In order to make players use more consummables, just simply remove all weapons. If a player doesn't have any weapon, his only
        choice is to use consummables. 
    -   Introduction to each consummables should be showned how it's used such as a bottle that broke lure enemies in the vicinity.
